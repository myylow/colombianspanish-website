Hi there!

Thanks so much for buying my eBook…What a legend you are.

Any second now, you should be receiving **another email from us with your eBook files**, together with the instructions on how to access the publication on your device.

Keep an eye out for it in your inbox in the next few minutes (as a quick heads up: the message is the one sent from admin@colombianspanish.co, not the receipt you will have just received from GumRoad).

Be great to hear how you get on with it all over the following months — so please do keep me up to date with your progress.

And remember, if you have any problems along the way, or you think you’ve not been sent the files, please write to me directly at peter@colombianspanish.co and I’ll respond as soon as I can.

Happy studying!
